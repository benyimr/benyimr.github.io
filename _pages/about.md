I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Graduate Research Fellow at the [MIT Governance Lab](https://mitgovlab.org/). I study comparative political behavior, focusing on how citizens interact with state bureaucracies and public services, with a substantive interest in crime and insecurity in Latin America.
