I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Graduate Research Fellow at the [MIT Governance Lab](https://mitgovlab.org/).






Before joining MIT, I earned a BA and MA in Political Science from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and worked as Technical Coordinator of the [Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LD4BPH) at the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES).

You can find my CV [here]({{ '/files/Academic_CV__BMR.pdf' | relative_url }}).

If you’d like to discuss my research, academic work, or the PhD path, you can reach me at [benja_mr@mit.edu](mailto: benja_mr@mit.edu).
